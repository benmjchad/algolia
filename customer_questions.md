# Customer questions

## Question 1:

``
Hello,
I'm new to search engines, and there are a lot of concepts I'm not educated on. To make my onboarding smoother, it'd help if you could provide me with some definitions of the following concepts:
Records
Indexing
I'm also struggling with understanding what types of metrics would be useful to include in the "Custom Ranking."
Cheers, George

Hi George

I understand where you’re coming from! There’s a lot to learn when you start out with search. The good news is that you can still build out a great search experience by keeping it simple to start with.

A record is information (specifically an object, or collection of properties) that can be searched for. An index is where records are stored. We use indexes so that your users can search amongst your records quickly.

When a search experience provides results, it’s important that those results are accurate and ranked. Algolia is well tuned out of the box, but you can help us understand your business even better and tweak the rankings. To put this in the context of what you do for Internet Movie Database, our default ranking will do a great job at matching records based on typos, geolocation, filters etc and more. Custom rankings can be setup so that a search for “spielberg films” will put Spielberg’s most popular films at the top of the results. This leverages the business knowledge that IMDB understands much more deeply than anybody else does.

# Question 2:

```
Hello,
Sorry to give you the kind of feedback that I know you do not want to hear, but I really hate the new dashboard design. Clearing and deleting indexes are now several clicks away. I am needing to use these features while iterating, so this is inconvenient.
Regards, Matt

Hi Matt

Thank you for taking the time to send us your feedback. Algolia aims for continuous improvement, and we always value it, good or bad!

I’ll pass your note to our Product Feedback program. I’ll make sure we update you if there is any change.

To make your development simpler, have you thought of using the API? You might find that scripting this task is even quicker than the previous dashboard design.

I know you generally script in PHP. For more information, please see these links:

## Question 3:

```
Hi,
I'm looking to integrate Algolia in my website. Will this be a lot of development work for me? What's the high level process look like?
Regards, Leo
```

[Answered from a pre-sale POV]

Hi Leo

Algolia provides a set of tools that simplify the process of making and integrating a full search experience into your sites and applications. We provide a dashboard that enables business and marketing teams to engage and customize the search experience of your users, leaving you as a developer to focus on higher value tasks.

You can break down how to implement Algolia into three high-level steps:
1. Indexing your data into Algolia.
2. Configuring relevance and ranking settings.
3. Building a search user interface.
We offer pre-built libraries that let you build a feature rich solution with little friction, and it’s possible to stand-up a search solution within minutes.

I’d like to spend time discovering the requirements you and the team at Acquia have, and then demo a solution. I’m free all of tomorrow and Friday afternoon if you can make time to chat.
